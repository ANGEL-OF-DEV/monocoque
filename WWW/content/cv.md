## Costa Express

### Lead Software Developer

<p dates>From AUG 2019</p>

![](/cv/costa_lsd.webp){style=float:right;max-height:250px;margin-top:20px;margin-left:1em;}

Costa, the second-largest coffeehouse chain in the world, was acquired by The Coca-Cola Company in 2019 together with
over
15,000 coffee vending machines branded as Costa Express.
The software running inside Express machines was written over many years by an external engineer who has retired and no
longer
maintained it. The terms of acquisition required
Costa to bring the development of vending machines in-house and I was asked to join as lead developer to build the team
and
deliver the changes requested in time for Tokyo Summer
Olympics when the machines will be presented.

<div print-exclude>

---

I was given text files with source code (.NET Framework 4 and C++, no unit tests), latest binaries known to work in
production
and hardware documentation written in German. As luck
would have it, a group of developers were available to join almost right away, some of whom I have worked with before.
We agreed
the basics (Azure DevOps, git) and created build
pipeline for the .NET code, giving us the most
basic [Continuous Integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration) as a starting point. We were not
able to
build
C++ code but using production binaries and through trial and error we discovered all run-time dependencies and
successfully
deployed to a baseline test machine.

</div>

---

By the time of COVID 19 I understood the machines and the codebase very well, managed to grow my team to 8 developers +
4
testers, implemented
[CI/CD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CI/CD) pipelines, established Pull Request / Code Review culture and secured
enough
hardware to meet our growing needs. As the team matured we
got better at planning and estimating, which in turn improved confidence that we can deliver and I was asked to prepare
for
development of a new flagship machine - the first one to
dispense iced drinks as well as hot coffee.

<div print-exclude>

---

Installing first software team within an organisation not previously exposed to in-house development and not uniformly
committed
to the decision in the first place came with many
demands and continuous uncertainty, but I did enjoy the challenge and appreciate all the lessons learned from this
experience.

</div>

### Lead Software Developer

<p dates>COVID / Lockdowns</p>

<div print-exclude>

When China announced COVID restrictions I worked with the business on a contingency plan in case UK followed with
similar
restrictions. We identified <b>Over-The-Air Updates</b>
and <b>Contactless Ordering</b> as core prerequisites for operational continuity and together with my most senior
developers we
delivered those in record time ensuring that our
machines continue operating in hospitals and other locations during lockdown.

---

</div>

My team continued working at good pace through COVID allowing me to shift focus to a bigger picture. I used this time to
speak
with other groups at Costa looking for opportunities
for my team to grow but those turned out to be very fragmented with no quick wins. Rather than focusing on individual
items I
collated them all into a draft of technology strategy.

<div print-exclude>

Several themes emerged from this view:

- Shift from WPF UI to Web UI, unlocking access to much richer ecosystem of packages, tools and integrations
- Shift Left Testing, bringing test automation early in the development process
- Take ownership of Cloud/IoT, removing rigid third party from equation, allowing us extra degree of freedom

</div>

With that I reached out to stakeholders for help in refining and framing of the strategy in terms of value added to the
business
and soon was given time to prototype proposed
solutions. After several iterations my prototypes were accepted and I was offered Technical Architect position to
oversee
implementation by the team.

## Mercedes AMG

<h3> Contract Developer <wbr/> (High&nbsp;Perf.&nbsp;Powertrains) </h3>

<p dates>From MAR 2019</p>

![](/cv/merc.webp){class=maybe style=height:270px;display:block;margin:auto;float:right;margin-right:-11em;margin-top-30px;}

<ul>
<li>I took a rare opportunity to work inside Mercedes technology campus on a short project bringing together data from Formula 1 and Formula E engine development.</li>
<li>Working directly with performance engineers I collected their requirements and implemented changes to existing .NET software, SQL Server tables, views and stored procedures.</li>
<li print-exclude>The people on campus left a lasting impression on me and I have learned a great deal from their systematic approach to productivity and process efficiency.</li>
</ul>

## Red Bull Racing Formula One

### Software Engineer (Vehicle&nbsp;Dynamics)

<p dates>From 2017</p>

<ul>
<li>Joined Race Strategy and Vehicle Performance Group to work on a new pit wall software to replace a number of existing tools by providing unified, fully reactive models and a
  common messaging infrastructure.</li>
<li>.NET software with WPF front-end made of three core components: Compute Models, Stochastic Models and Visualizations.</li>
<li>Compute Models collect live information from data feeds (FIA Timing, GPS, car sensors, weather and more) to build an internal representation of an ongoing race.</li>
<li print-exclude>Live event data is often incomplete, mislabeled, delayed, out of order or completely missing. For that reason models use persistent, immutable data structures that keep track of
  previous versions and allow partial rebuild of state from a moment in the past when missing data eventually arrives or a correction is issued.</li>
<li>Stochastic Models (machine learning / Monte Carlo methods) use outputs of Compute Models, historical data and additional parameters to explore large space of possible outcomes
  and predict the most likely future.</li>
<li>Visualisations bring together known state from Compute Models and the most likely predictions from Stochastic Models to let performance and strategy engineers understand
  potential impact of their decisions before they fully commit to them.</li>
<li>This was the most demanding but at the same time the most rewarding project in my F1 career. It required me to acquire significant amount of domain knowledge, mathematical
  understanding and foundations of machine learning to communicate with some of the smartest people I have ever met.</li>
</ul>

### Software Engineer (Aerodynamics)

<p dates>From 2013</p>

![](/cv/rbr-dr.webp){class=maybe style=height:250px;display:block;margin:auto;float:right;margin-right:-16em;}

<ul>
<li>Working directly with heads of Wind Tunnel, Computational Fluid Dynamics and Aero Performance I was a technical lead on a long-term software strategy bringing together data and
  reporting across the three groups.</li>
<li>The performance has been the core feature of this WPF application and a major point of focus throughout the development and I have spent significant effort optimizing the time it
  takes to find, retrieve and visualize the data, analysing database query performance (SQL Server Profiler), implementing multi-threaded data processing and creating fast
  visualizations.</li>
<li print-exclude>I used Team Foundation Server to manage sprints and backlog of work items which were refined every two weeks during steering group meetings, where I had to respond to competing demands from different stakeholders.</li>
<li>This position required me to make difficult decisions regarding development plans and justify those decisions to people whose demands could not always be met all at the same time.</li>
</ul>

### Software Engineer (Wind&nbsp;Tunnel)

<p dates>From SEP 2012</p>

![](/cv/rbr-mv.webp){class=maybe style=height:250px;display:block;margin:auto;float:right;margin-right:-16em;margin-top:-30px;}

<ul>
<li>Designed and developed Test Spec – a WPF tool used by Aerodynamics department to manage wind tunnel tests and provide real-time diagnostics, allowing tests to be stopped if an
  issue is detected.</li>
<li print-exclude>Concurrent users connect from two different locations (Wind Tunnel / Factory) with software automatically detecting the source of connection and adjusting to expected workflow.</li>
<li>Event-driven architecture allows engineers at the Wind Tunnel to continue with their tasks even when connectivity to Factory is temporarily lost.</li>
</ul>

### Software Engineer (Race&nbsp;Strategy)

<p dates>From OCT 2010</p>

<ul>
<li>Worked on Race Strategy Client – a critical application used trackside by race strategists during Formula 1 races.</li>
<li print-exclude>The app uses WCF for client–server communication, collects real–time data from different feeds and, using Monte Carlo simulation, tries to predict possible outcomes of a race.</li>
<li>Improved performance and stability of existing components by replacing old threading model with parallel processing available in .NET.</li>
</ul>

![](/cv/rbr-fit-lab.webp){style=width:80%;display:block;margin:auto;}

## Visual Studio Industrial Partner

<p dates>2010-2012</p>
